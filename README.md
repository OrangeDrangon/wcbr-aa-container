# WCBR AA Container

Builds AA image with custom dependencies for deployment.

A build is kicked off when Containerfile, requirements.txt, or the build.yaml
changes. It can also be triggered via manual action.

Renovatebot runs every 4 hours to notify you of new packages. It also helpfully
includes release notes for packages that do releases properly.
